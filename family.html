<p>I am from <strong>Varkala</strong>, a stunning coastal town in Kerala, India.  
Varkala is famous for its dramatic <strong>red laterite cliffs</strong> that overlook the Arabian Sea, 
the serene <strong>Papanasam Beach</strong>, natural mineral springs, and the historic <strong>Janardanaswamy Temple</strong>.
Itâ€™s a peaceful blend of spirituality and breathtaking scenery.</p>

<p>My family consists of four members: my parents (working abroad), my brother who is currently undergoing <strong>pilot training</strong>, and me. 
Their support inspires my journey in academics and creativity.</p>
